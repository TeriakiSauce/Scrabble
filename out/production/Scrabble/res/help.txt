How to Play:

    Goal:

        To win the game, you need to get the highest number of points. You can get points by making various words
        on the board, which will be automatically validated. Certain words may be worth more or less points,
        depending on the value of the letters, the number of letters, and if the word was made over any modifiers.
        Essentially, you win the game by making the longest and most complex words whilst achieving using modifiers.

    Setup:

        When creating a new game, you have the opportunity to specify your name, and to add any number of
        computer players. Once you have specified your desired settings, you can click start and the game will begin.

    Playing:

        Once you have started a game, you will see the scoreboard to the left, various information at the top,
        several actions to the right, your hand at the bottom, and the board in the center. At the top, the current
        player and turn number will be listed. When the current player is listed as your name, it is time for you to
        make a turn.

        When making a turn, you currently have two options. You can attempt to place a word, or you can skip your
        turn. To make a word, select the desired letter you wish to place from your hand and click on the desired
        location. For the location to be valid, it must be within the board, currently empty and attached to another
        word with a few exceptions. Once you have placed your letters, you can click finish to end your turn and
        validate the word the you created. If the word is valid, you will receive points and the turn will be passed
        on to the next player. If the word was invalid, your letters will be returned.

Special Rules:

    First Turn:

        Usually, to place a word, you must place a word consisting of at least two letters and connected to another
        word. For the first turn however, the player has to place their word at the center of the board. In
        addition, they are allowed to make a word consisting of a single letter.

    Modifiers:

        There exists several modifiers on the board which increase the points that you may receive when placing a 
        word. These modifiers include double letter score, triple letter score, double word score, and triple word
        score. They are indicated by the colours light blue, dark blue, pink, and red, respectively.
